# env variables come from one of the following:
# 1. defined within shell command of a run step (e.g. FOO=BAR, FOO="BAR")
# 2. declared with environment key for a run step
# 3. declared with environment key for a job
# 4. built-in variables
# 5. context
# 6. project-level

# env variables are used in one of the following ways:
# 1. by orbs (under the hood)
# 2. $VARIABLE_NAME
# 3. ${VARIABLE_NAME}
# 4. OTHER?
